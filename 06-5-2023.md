## Algorithm for Question 2: Whoâ€™s the fastest runner?
```
1. Initialize variables for each runner's running speed, running time, and rest time.
2. Define a function called "calculateDistance" that takes in the runner's running speed, running time, rest time, and total time as inputs and returns the total distance covered by the runner.
3. Within the "calculateDistance" function, calculate the number of complete cycles the runner can complete in the given total time.
4. Calculate the distance covered by the runner in each cycle by multiplying the runner's running speed by their running time.
5. Calculate the total distance covered by the runner in the complete cycles by multiplying the distance covered in each cycle by the number of complete cycles.
6. Calculate the remaining time the runner has after completing the complete cycles.
7. If the runner has remaining time, calculate the additional distance the runner can cover during that time.
8. Add the additional distance to the total distance covered by the runner.
9. Return the total distance covered by the runner.
10. Define a constant variable for the total time.
11. Calculate the distance covered by each runner using the "calculateDistance" function.
12. Output the distance covered by each runner to the console.
13. Find the winning runner by comparing the distances covered by each runner and output the winning runner's distance to the console.

Each runner's scenario is handled within the "calculateDistance" function. The function takes in the runner's running speed, running time, rest time, and total time as inputs, and calculates the total distance covered by the runner. If the runner has enough time to complete at least one cycle, the function calculates the distance covered by the runner in each complete cycle and adds it to the total distance covered by the runner. If the runner has remaining time after completing the complete cycles, the function calculates the additional distance the runner can cover during that time and adds it to the total distance covered by the runner. The function then returns the total distance covered by the runner.

After running the code in the file 06-5-2023.c, it should output "The distance covered by the winning runner(Jenna) is : 3540.00 meters"
