## Algorithm for Question 6: How many steps are needed to disconnect the string? 

```
1. Define a function named findMinimumDeletion that takes the left index (l), right index (r), a memoization array (dp), and the input string (s) as parameters.
2. If l is greater than r, return 0. This represents the base case when there are no nodes to delete.
3. If l is equal to r, return 1. This represents the base case when there is only one node to delete.
4. If the value of dp[l][r] is already computed and stored, return the stored value.
5. Initialize a variable named res as 1 + the result of the recursive call to findMinimumDeletion with the left index incremented by 1, the right index unchanged, and the same dp and s parameters. This represents the case when a single character is deleted from the current substring.
6. Iterate from i = l + 1 to r:
   - Check if the character at index l is equal to the character at index i.
   - If they are equal, calculate the minimum of res and the sum of two recursive calls to findMinimumDeletion:
     - The first recursive call with the left index incremented by 1, i - 1 as the new right index, and the same dp and s parameters. This represents deleting the characters between l and i.
     - The second recursive call with i as the new left index, r unchanged, and the same dp and s parameters. This represents deleting the characters after i.
7. Store the value of res in dp[l][r] for future reference.
8. Return the value of res.

To find the minimum number of delete operations, call the findMinimumDeletion function with initial parameters of l = 0, r = n - 1 (where n is the length of the input string), an empty dp array, and the input string s.

After runnung the C language code in the file 14-5-2023.c(please check it out), it should display "78 steps is needed to disconect the string"
