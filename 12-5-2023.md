## Algorithm for Question 5: What do I say when I am decoded? 

```
1. Define a struct Node with three fields: a char letter, and two pointers to Nodes left and right.
2. Define a function add_node that takes a Node** pointer and a char letter, allocates memory for a new Node and sets its fields, and sets the pointer to point to the new Node.
3. Define a function decode_helper that takes a char* encoded message, a Node* root, a pointer to an index, and a char* result message.
4. In decode_helper, initialize a Node* curr pointer to the root Node.
5. While curr->left or curr->right is not NULL:
    a. Check the next character of encoded at the current index.
    b. If it is '0', set curr to curr->left.
    c. If it is '1', set curr to curr->right.
    d. If it is neither '0' nor '1', print an error message and exit the program.
    e. Increment the index.
6. Add curr->letter to the end of result.
7. Define a function decode that takes a char* encoded message, a Node* root, and a char* result message.
8. In decode, initialize an index to 0.
9. While index is less than the length of encoded:
    a. Call decode_helper with encoded, root, index, and result as arguments.
10. Define main.
11. Initialize a char* encoded message.
12. Initialize a Node* root with an empty letter and NULL left and right pointers.
13. Initialize two arrays of strings: one for letters and one for their corresponding codewords.
14. Use add_node to add a Node for each letter in the letters array to the root of the tree, with their corresponding codewords defining the left and right paths.
15. Use decode to decode the encoded message using the Huffman coding tree and store the result in a char* result message.
16. Print the result.
```

After runnung the C language code in the file 12-5-2023.c(please check it out), it should display "Decoded message: i love angelhack code challenge because it is fun and exciting and i dislike the word yab that appears in the phrase"
