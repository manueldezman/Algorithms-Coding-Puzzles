## Algorithm for Question 7: What is the score?

```
1. Define the constants ROWS and COLS to represent the number of rows and columns in the layout.
2. Implement the print_layout function to print the layout.
3. Implement the next_minute_layout function to calculate the next layout based on the rules of the game.
4. Implement the main function:
   - Declare and initialize the start_state array with the initial layout.
   - Print the start state using the print_layout function.
   - Declare and initialize the layouts array to store encountered layouts.
   - Declare and initialize minute as 1 to track the number of minutes passed.
   - Declare and initialize layouts_count as 1 to track the number of layouts stored.
   - Copy the start_state to the first element of the layouts array.
   - Declare and initialize lifeform_score as 0 to track the total lifeform score.
   - Enter an infinite loop:
     - Create a new_layout array to store the next minute's layout.
     - Calculate the next layout using the next_minute_layout function with the previous layout.
     - Check if the next layout is repeated by comparing it with previously encountered layouts using memcmp.
     - If the next layout is repeated:
       - Set repeated as 1.
       - Print the minute and the repeated layout using the print_layout function.
       - Calculate the lifeform score by iterating over each element of the repeated layout:
         - If the element is 'X', calculate the tile number and the tile value using the row and column indices and the pow function.
         - Add the tile value to the lifeform_score.
       - Break out of the loop.
     - If the next layout is not repeated:
       - Copy the next layout to the layouts array at the current layouts_count index.
       - Print the minute and the next layout using the print_layout function.
       - Increment the minute and layouts_count by 1.
   - Print the lifeform_score for the first layout that appears twice.
   - Return 0 to indicate successful execution.
   ```
   After runnung the C language code in the file 16-5-2023.c(please check it out), it should display "Lifeform score for the first layout that appears twice is: 32509983"
