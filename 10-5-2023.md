## Algorithm for Question 4: Find the groupâ€™s efficiency
```
1. Initialize the array of efficiencies
2. Calculate the number of workers (n) from the length of the efficiency array
3. Sort the efficiency array in ascending order
4. Initialize a variable (min_cost) to hold the minimum cost of the task
5. Loop through the array of efficiencies excluding each worker once
6.    Allocate memory for the array of pairs and the array of remaining efficiencies
7.    Initialize variables to track the current pair index (pair_idx) and the remaining efficiency index (eff_idx)
8.    Loop through the remaining efficiencies, pairing up adjacent workers and storing the pairs in the pairs array
9.    Calculate the total cost of the task for the current pairing configuration by looping through the pairs array and summing the absolute differences between the efficiency ratings of each pair
10.   If the current cost is less than the minimum cost, update the minimum cost
11.   Free the memory allocated for the array of pairs and the array of remaining efficiencies
12. Output the minimum cost of the task
13. End
```

After runnung the C language code in the file 10-5-2023.c(please check it out), it should display "Minimum cost of task: 475"
