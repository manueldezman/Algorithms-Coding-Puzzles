Algorithm for "Question 1: Which floor am I on?":

1. Initialize a character array "navigation" with the input string representing the navigation instructions.
2. Initialize two integer variables: "present_floor" and "i" to zero.
3. Start a loop that iterates through each character in the "navigation" array until the end of the array is reached.
4. Check if the current character is '<'.
5. If the character is '<', increment the "present_floor" variable.
6. Check if the current character is '>'.
7. If the character is '>', decrement the "present_floor" variable.
8. Increment the "i" variable to move to the next character in the "navigation" array.
9. When the loop has ended, output the final floor number stored in the "present_floor" variable.
