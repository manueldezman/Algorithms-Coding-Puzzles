## Algorithm for Question 3: Is the permutation divisible by 7?
```
1. Define a function `swap` that takes two integer pointers as input and swaps their values.
2. Define a recursive function `permute` that takes an integer array, a starting index, an ending index, a minimum value pointer, and a maximum value pointer as input.
3. If the starting index is equal to the ending index, the function has generated a permutation. Calculate the permutation value and display it. If the permutation value is divisible by 7, update the minimum and maximum values using the pointers.
4. If the starting index is not equal to the ending index, iterate over all possible values that can be swapped with the starting index, swap them with the starting index, call `permute` recursively with the updated array, and swap the values back to their original position.
5. Define the main function.
6. Declare an integer array with the digits 1, 8, 6, 7 and find its size.
7. Declare two variables to keep track of the minimum and maximum permutation values that are divisible by 7. Initialize the minimum value to 9999 and the maximum value to 0.
8. Display a message indicating that all permutation values will be displayed.
9. Call the `permute` function with the integer array, the starting index of 0, the ending index of n-1, and the minimum and maximum value pointers.
10. If no permutation was found that is divisible by 7, display a message indicating that no such permutation was found and exit the program.
11. Calculate the average of the minimum and maximum permutation values that are divisible by 7.
12. Display the smallest permutation value that is divisible by 7.
13. Display the largest permutation value that is divisible by 7.
14. Display the average of the smallest and largest permutation values that are divisible by 7.
15. End the program.
```
After runnung the C language code in the file 08-5-2023.c(please check it out), it should display "Average of smallest and largest permutation values divisible by 7: 5152.00"
